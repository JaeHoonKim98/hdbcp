Description: Functions based on "Bayesian Optimal Change Point Detection in High Dimension" (Kim et al., 2024), implementing the paperâ€™s change point detection methods.
    Additionally, the package includes tools for generating simulated datasets with specific covariance and mean structures, enabling robust comparison and evaluation of change point detection techniques.
